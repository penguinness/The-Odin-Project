# 1. Introduction

Web developers build and maintain websites.

- Front-end developers work on the browser side.

- Back-end developers work on the server side.

- Full-stack developers work on both.

In general, to become a proper developer, one must need to learn to build projects, read documentations, and experiment with new technologies. In order to do these, one must have a **growth mindset** (i.e. a desire to improve without being afraid of failure).

The following diagram proves quite helpful for setting up a proper learning routine:

It is important for one to put in consistent work on a daily basis. Likewise, it is also important for one to take breaks to sustain one's physical and mental fitness to continue working. Staying consistent and taking breaks are not mutually exclusive.

One should also learn to ask for help, that is, to format the right questions and to format the right follow-up questions. It is not possible for one to solve all problems on their own, and that is okay.
