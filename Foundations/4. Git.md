# 4. Git

**Git** is a version control system. A **version control system** (VCS) is a system that keeps track of changes made to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Most Git operations are local. Git allows developers to keep track of changes to the code and revert to such previous versions if desired.

There are several different types of VCSs:

- Local version control systems:

- Distributed version control systems:

In a Git workflow, files can be one of three states: modified, staged, and committed.

**GitHub** is a remote storage facility built on top of Git. GitHub allows developers to collaborate with one another seamlessly.
