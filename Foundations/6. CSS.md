# 6. CSS

A CSS element is made up of a selector (that decides which HTML element to style) with a property-value pair:

![alt text](/Images/image-8.png)

There are multiple types of selectors:

- Universal selectors:

  ```CSS
  * {
  color: purple;
  }
  ```

- Type selectors: Select all elements of a given type

  ```HTML
  <!-- index.html -->

  <div>Hello, World!</div>
  <div>Hello again!</div>
  <p>Hi...</p>
  <div>Okay, bye.</div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  div {
     color: white;
  }
  ```

- Class selectors: Select all elements of a given class attribute

  ```HTML
  <!-- index.html -->

  <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  .alert-text {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

- ID selectors: Select all elements of a given ID attribute

  ```HTML
  <!-- index.html -->

  <div id="title">My Awesome 90's Page</div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  #title {
  background-color: red;
  }
  ```

- Grouping selectors:
  We can group together selectors that share some of their declarations.

  - Ungrouped:

  ```CSS
    .read {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
        /* several unique declarations */
    }

    .unread {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
        /* several unique declarations */
    }
  ```

  - Grouped:

  ```CSS
    .read,
    .unread {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
    }

    .read {
        /* several unique declarations */
    }

    .unread {
        /* several unique declarations */
    }
  ```

- Chaining selectors:

  We can chain class selectors of the same class:

  ```HTML
  <div>
    <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
    <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
  </div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  .subsection.header {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

  We can also chain a class and an ID:

  ```HTML
  <div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">
      This is where a preview for a post might go.
  </p>
  </div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  .subsection.header {
    color: red;
  }

  .subsection#preview {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

- Descendant combinators:

  ```HTML
  <!-- index.html -->

  <div class="ancestor">
  <!-- A -->
  <div class="contents">
      <!-- B -->
      <div class="contents"><!-- C --></div>
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contents"><!-- D --></div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  .ancestor .contents {
     /* some declarations */
  }
  ```

In the above example, the first two elements with the contents class (B and C) would be selected, but that last element (D) wouldn’t be.

Here are some common CSS properties:

- Color and background-color:

  ```CSS
  p {
    /* hex example: */
    color: #1100ff;
  }

  p {
    /* rgb example: */
    color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
  }

  p {
    /* hsl example: */
    color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
  }
  ```

- Typography:

  - `font-family`:

    `font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;`

  - `font-size`:

    `font-size: 22px`

  - `font-weight`:

    `font-weight: bold`

    `font-weight: 700`

  - `text-align`:

    `text-align: center`

- Image height and width:

  ```CSS
  img {
    height: auto;
    width: 500px;
  }
  ```

There are three ways to add CSS to HTML:

- External CSS:

  ```HTML
  <!-- index.html -->

  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  ```

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  div {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
  }

  p {
    color: red;
  }
  ```

- Internal CSS:

  ```HTML
  <head>
    <style>
        div {
            color: white;
            background-color: black;
        }

        p {
            color: red;
        }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
  ...
  </body>
  ```

- Inline CSS:

  ```HTML
  <body>
      <div style="color: white; background-color: black;">...</div>
  </body>
  ```

## The Cascade

The cascade is an algorithm that determines (i.e. ranks and picks) which CSS rules to apply to the HTML code. There are some principles that the cascade uses to do so:

- Specificity:

  Generally speaking, ID selectors are the most specific selectors, followed by class selectors, and then type selectors. When there is no declaration with a selector of higher specificity, a rule with a greater number of selectors of the same type will take precedence over another rule with fewer selectors of the same type.

  To understand this concept, consider the following examples.

  - Example 1:

    ```HTML
    <!-- index.html -->

    <div class="main">
      <div class="list subsection">Red text</div>
    </div>
    ```

    ```CSS
    /* rule 1 */
    .subsection {
      color: blue;
    }

    /* rule 2 */
    .main .list {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

    In this example, `color: red` would take precedence because it uses more class selectors.

  - Example 2:

    ```HTML
    <!-- index.html -->

    <div class="main">
      <div class="list" id="subsection">Blue text</div>
    </div>
    ```

    ```CSS
    /* rule 1 */
    #subsection {
      color: blue;
    }

    /* rule 2 */
    .main .list {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

    In this example, `color: blue` would take precedence because it uses an ID selector, which has higher specificity than class selectors.

  - Example 3:

    ```HTML
    <!-- index.html -->

    <div class="main">
      <div class="list" id="subsection">Red text on yellow background</div>
    </div>
    ```

    ```CSS
    /* rule 1 */
    #subsection {
      background-color: yellow;
      color: blue;
    }

    /* rule 2 */
    .main #subsection {
    color: red;
    }
    ```

    In this example, both rules have one ID selector, but rule 2 also has a class selector while rule 1 has no additional selector. Hence, the cascade would choose rule 2 to apply to the HTML code.

    While the `color: red` declaration would take precedence, the `background-color: yellow` declaration would still be applied since there’s no conflicting declaration for it.

- Inheritance:

  Inheritance refers to CSS properties that are inherited by descendants of targeted elements. The exception to this is when directly targeting an element, as this always beats inheritance:

  ```HTML
  <!-- index.html -->

  <div id="parent">
    <div class="child"></div>
  </div>
  ```

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  #parent {
    color: red;
  }

  .child {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

  Despite the parent element having a higher specificity with an ID, the child element would have the `color: blue` style applied since that declaration directly targets it, while `color: red` from the parent is only inherited.

- Rule order:

  If multiple rules are still in consideration after all tie-breakers have been applied, the last defined rule will be chosen by the cascade.

  ```CSS
  /* styles.css */

  .alert {
    color: red;
  }

  .warning {
    color: yellow;
  }
  ```

  If an element contains both the `alert` and `warning` classes, `color: yellow` will be chosen since `.warning` is defined last.

## The Box Model

Everything in CSS follows **the box model**:

![alt text](/Images/image-9.png)

- Content:

  ```CSS
  div {
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```

  ![alt text](/Images/image-10.png)

- Padding:

  ```CSS
  div {
    padding: 20px; /* This is a padding */
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```

  ![alt text](/Images/image-11.png)

- Border:

  ```CSS
  div {
    border: 30px solid blue; /* This is a border */
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```

  ![alt text](/Images/image-12.png)

- Margin:

  ```CSS
  div {
    margin: 20px; /* This is a margin */
    border: 30px solid blue;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```

  ![alt text](/Images/image-13.png)

- Margin collapse:

  ```CSS
  .top-div {
    margin: 30px;
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
  }

  .bottom-div {
    margin: 40px;
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
  }
  ```

  ![alt text](/Images/image-14.png)

- Box-sizing:

  ```CSS
  .top-div {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    background-color: red;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 10px solid purple;
  }

  .bottom-div {
    box-sizing: content-box;
    background-color: orange;
    height: 100px;
    width: 200px;
    padding: 20px;
    border: 10px solid green;
  }
  ```

  ![alt text](/Images/image-15.png)

Border-box restricted the entire apparatus (excluding margin) to the specified height and width. Content-box sets the content portion to the specified height and width, and then applies the padding, border, and margin accordingly.

In fact, the margin does not count towards the size of the box. A positive margin pushes other elements away from it. A negative margin pulls other elements towards it.

Some (review) notes:

- From inside to outside, the order of box-model properties is: content, padding, border, margin.

- The box-sizing CSS property allows us to choose between the two box models: content-box and border-box. Border-box sets the entire box model to the specified height and width. Content-box sets only the content portion to the specified height and width.

- To create more space between 2 elements, use `margin`.

- To create more space between an element and its border, use `padding`.

- To make 2 elements overlap each other, use `margin`.

- To set the alternative box models for all elements, type

  ```CSS
  html {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  ```

- To center an element horizontally, use `margin: 0 auto;`.

Block elements (default style: `display: block`) always start on a new line. Inline elements (default style: `display: inline`) appear in line with the elements they're placed beside.

Divs and spans are hook elements with unlimited customization options. Divs are block elements. Spans are inline elements.

## Flexbox

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` in it. A flex item is any element that is inside a flex container.

![alt text](/Images/image-16.png)

A flex item can also be a flex container.

![alt text](/Images/image-17.png)

The `flex` declaration is a shorthand for 3 properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`.

- `flex-grow` grows a flex item by a factor.

- `flex-shrink` shrinks a flex item by a factor.

- `flex-basis` sets the initial size of a flex item.

For example, `flex: 1` equates to: `flex-grow: 1`, `flex-shrink: 1`, `flex-basis: 0`.

The four common `flex` values are:

| `flex` Value     | `flex-grow` | `flex-shrink` | `flex-basis` | Behavior                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flex: initial`  | 0           | 1             | auto         | Sized based on width/height or content, won't grow but can shrink.              |
| `flex: auto`     | 1           | 1             | auto         | Sized based on width/height or content, will grow to fill space and can shrink. |
| `flex: none`     | 0           | 0             | auto         | Sized based on width/height or content, won't grow or shrink.                   |
| `flex: <number>` | `<number>`  | 1             | 0            | Grows proportionally based on the number, can shrink, base size is zero.        |

There are two flex directions:

- `flex-direction: row` sets the main axis to the horizontal axis. This is the default setting for flexbox.

- `flex-direction: column` sets the main axis to the vertical axis. In a `column` flex container, `flex-basis` refers to `height` instead of `width`

There are two ways to align flex items:

- `justify-content` aligns flex items across the **main axis**.

- `align-items` aligns flex items across the **cross axis**.

We can use `gap` to separate flex items by a specified distance.
