# 3. Command Line

## The Unix Shell

This section contains my notes as I work on Software Carpentry's [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).

The **file system** is the part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories.

- `pwd` prints out the current working directory.

- `ls` prints out the names of the files and directories in the current working directory.

  - `ls -F` prints out the names of the files and directories with classification markers (/ = directory, @ = link, \* = executable, no classifier = file).

  - `man ls` redirects to the manual page of the `ls` command. To quit the manual page, press Q.

## Review

The **command line** is the interface where we can communicate with the computer using shell commands. To open the command line on MacOS, simply open "Terminal".
