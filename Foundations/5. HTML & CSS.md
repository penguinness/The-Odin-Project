# 5. HTML & CSS

A typical web application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) determines the structure and the content of a website (i.e. text, links, cards, lists, and buttons).

- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) determines the style of a website (i.e. colors, font styles, layout and responsive features).

- JavaScript determines the functionality of a website.

## 5.1. HTML

An HTML element contains 3 parts:

- an opening tag
- some content
- a closing tag

For example, consider the following paragraph element:

```HTML
<p>some text content</p>
```

In this example,

- `<p>` is the opening tag
- `some text content` is the enclosed content
- `</p>` is the closing tag

There are some HTML elements without a closing tag, such as `<br>` or `<img>`.

The following analogy sums up neatly how HTML elements work:

The boilerplate code for `index.html` can be generated by typing `!` and Enter:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

Some notes on the boilerplate code:

- The DOCTYPE declaration is to specify which version of HTML the browser should use to run our code.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of every html document.
- The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the website.
- The `<body>` element contains the content that will be displayed to the users.

Here are the essential HTML elements:

- Paragraphs:

```HTML
    <p> This is a paragraph </p>
```

- Headings:

```HTML
    <h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
```

- Strong elements:

```HTML
<strong>This is a strong element.</strong>
```

- Emphasized elements:

```HTML
<em>This is an emphasized element.</em>
```

- Comments:

```HTML
<h1> View the html to see the hidden comments </h1>

<!-- I am an html comment -->

<p>Some paragraph text</p>

<!-- I am another html comment -->
```

- Unordered lists:

```HTML
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

- Ordered lists:

```HTML
<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

- Links:

There are two types of HTML links: absolute links and relative links.

Absolute links are links to other webpages:

```HTML
<a
    href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
    About The Odin Project
</a>
```

Relative links are links to pages located within our own website:

```HTML
<a href="./pages/about.html"> About </a>
```

- Images:

Images can be displayed using an absolute path:

```HTML
<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
```

Images can also be displayed using a relative path:

```HTML
<img src="./images/dog.jpg" />
```

Every image element must also have an alt attribute:

```HTML
<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">
```

Images' sizes can also be formatted:

```HTML
<img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo" height="310" width="310">
```

Note that dimension values are specified in pixels.

There are four main image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, and SVG.
