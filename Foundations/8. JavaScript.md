## Variables

Variables in JS can be declared using `let` or `const` (for constants):

```JS
let message;

message = 'Hello!';

message = 'World!'; // value changed

alert(message);
```

```JS
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
```

```JS
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
```

```JS
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00
```

Some naming conventions:

- Use camelCase

- Use human-readable names (e.g. use `userName` instead of `a`)

## Numbers

Here are some documentations that cover numbers and operators in JS:

- [W3Schools' JavaScript Arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

- [W3Schools' JavaScript Numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp)

- [Basic math in JavaScript â€” numbers and operators (mdn web docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math)

- [Basic operators, maths (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/operators#terms-unary-binary-operand)

Some review notes:

- Arithmetic operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponent)

- Increment and decrement operators: `++` (increment), `--` (decrement)

- Assignment operators: `=` (assignment), `+=` (addition assignment), `-=` (subtraction assignment), `*=` (multiplication assignment), `/=` (division assignment)

- Comparison operators: `==` (loose equality), `===` (strict equality), `!==` (strict non-equality), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), `>=` (greater than or equal to)

- Useful methods: `toFixed()` (rounding)
