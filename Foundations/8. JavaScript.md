# 8. JavaScript

## Variables

Variables in JS can be declared using `let` or `const` (for constants):

```JS
let message;

message = 'Hello!';

message = 'World!'; // value changed

alert(message);
```

```JS
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
```

```JS
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
```

```JS
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00
```

Some naming conventions:

- Use camelCase

- Use human-readable names (e.g. use `userName` instead of `a`)

## Numbers

Here are some documentations that cover numbers and operators in JS:

- [W3Schools' JavaScript Arithmetic](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp)

- [W3Schools' JavaScript Numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp)

- [Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators (mdn web docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math)

- [Basic operators, maths (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/operators#terms-unary-binary-operand)

Some review notes:

- Arithmetic operators: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponent)

- Increment and decrement operators: `++` (increment), `--` (decrement)

- Assignment operators: `=` (assignment), `+=` (addition assignment), `-=` (subtraction assignment), `*=` (multiplication assignment), `/=` (division assignment)

- Comparison operators: `==` (equality), `!=` (inequality), `===` (strict equality), `!==` (strict inequality), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), `>=` (greater than or equal to)

- Useful methods: `toFixed()` (rounding)

- Special values: `Infinity`, `NaN`

## Data Types and Conditionals

Below are some useful docs on data types, strings, and conditionals:

- [Data types (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/types)

- [Handling text — strings in JavaScript (mdn web docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)

- [JavaScript String Methods (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp)

- [mdn web docs' String documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)

- [Comparisons (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/comparison)

- [JavaScript if, else, and else if (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)

- [Logical operators (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/logical-operators)

- [Making decisions in your code — conditionals (mdn web docs)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

- [Conditional branching: if, '?' (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/ifelse)

- [The "switch" statement (javascript.info)](https://javascript.info/switch)

Some review notes:

- Logical operators: `||` (OR), `&&` (AND), `!` (NOT)

- If/else statements:

```JS
if (condition) {
  /* code to run if condition is true */
} else {
  /* run some other code instead */
}
```

- Switch statements:

```JS
switch (expression) {
  case choice1:
    // run this code
    break;

  case choice2:
    // run this code instead
    break;

  // include as many cases as you like

  default:
    // actually, just run this code
    break;
}
```

- Ternary operator:

```JS
condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
```

- Falsy values: `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`
