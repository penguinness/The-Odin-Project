# 7. Flexbox

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` in it. A flex item is any element that is inside a flex container.

A flex item can also be a flex container.

The `flex` declaration is a shorthand for 3 properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`.

- `flex-grow` grows a flex item by a factor.

- `flex-shrink` shrinks a flex item by a factor.

- `flex-basis` sets the initial size of a flex item.

For example, `flex: 1` equates to: `flex-grow: 1`, `flex-shrink: 1`, `flex-basis: 0`.

The four common `flex` values are:

| `flex` Value     | `flex-grow` | `flex-shrink` | `flex-basis` | Behavior                                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flex: initial`  | 0           | 1             | auto         | Sized based on width/height or content, won't grow but can shrink.              |
| `flex: auto`     | 1           | 1             | auto         | Sized based on width/height or content, will grow to fill space and can shrink. |
| `flex: none`     | 0           | 0             | auto         | Sized based on width/height or content, won't grow or shrink.                   |
| `flex: <number>` | `<number>`  | 1             | 0            | Grows proportionally based on the number, can shrink, base size is zero.        |

There are two flex directions:

- `flex-direction: row` sets the main axis to the horizontal axis. This is the default setting for flexbox.

- `flex-direction: column` sets the main axis to the vertical axis. In a `column` flex container, `flex-basis` refers to `height` instead of `width`

There are two ways to align flex items:

- `justify-content` aligns flex items across the **main axis**.

- `align-items` aligns flex items across the **cross axis**.

We can use `gap` to separate flex items by a specified distance.

Flexbox is a hard concept. These are some great Flexbox resources to refer to later on:

These are my notes as I go through Flexbox Zombies:

- `flex-direction` points the main axis to a specified direction: `row`, `column`, `row-reverse`, `column-reverse`

- `justify-content` aligns flex items along the main axis: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`.

- `align-items` aligns flex items along the cross axis: `flex-start`, `flex-end`
