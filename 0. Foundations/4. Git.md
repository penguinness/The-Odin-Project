# 4. Git

**Git** is a version control system. A **version control system** (VCS) is a system that keeps track of changes made to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Most Git operations are local. Git allows developers to keep track of changes to the code and revert to such previous versions if desired.

There are several different types of VCSs:

- Local version control systems:

- Centralized version control systems:

- Distributed version control systems:

In a Git workflow, files can be one of three states: modified, staged, and committed.

**GitHub** is a remote storage facility built on top of Git. GitHub allows developers to collaborate with one another seamlessly.

To create a new repository on GitHub, click `+` on the top right and select "New repository".

To copy a GitHub repository to the local machine, use `git clone + [ssh link]` or use the clone feature from VSCode.

The default name of a GitHub connection is "origin".

The default git branch is "main".

The two-stage system that git uses to save files is `git add` and `git commit`.

To check the git status of the current repository, use `git status`.

To commit the files in the staging area with a descriptive message, use `git commit -m`.

To push changes to a GitHub repository, use `git push`.

To view commit history, use `git log`.

Some notes on git branches:

- To make a new branch, use `git branch <branch_name>`.
- To change to the new branch, use `git checkout <branch_name>`.
- To make a new branch and change to it, use `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
- To change back to main, write `git checkout main`.
- To merge to main, use `git merge <branch_name>`.
- To delete a branch,
  - use `git branch -d <branch_name>` if the branch has already been merged into main
  - use `git branch -D <branch_name>` if it hasnâ€™t
